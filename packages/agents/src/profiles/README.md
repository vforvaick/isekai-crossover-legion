# Agent Profiles

This directory contains individual agent configurations and identity files.

Each agent subdirectory should contain:
- `identity.md` - Agent persona and behavior
- `config.json` - Agent-specific settings

## Active Agents

- `lelouch/` - Supreme Strategist
- `cc/` - Silent Analyst  
- `meliodas/` - DevOps Lead
- `shiroe/` - Trading Architect
- `demiurge/` - Security Auditor
- `rimuru/` - Data Engineer
- `senku/` - Research Specialist

## Integration Note

These profiles will be populated from VPS agent configurations during full migration.
For now, agent personas are documented in `/docs/PERSONAS.md`.
